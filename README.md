# mcpi-skyblock
Skyblock script for Minecraft: Pi Editon

Run it with python3 on a fresh MCPI world, and the script will make randomized islands with ores, trees, stone, etc.

## which file do I run?
Because perlin generation is under testing, I've decided to keep the original code. You can run play for the original code (feels like skyblock) or the new code (feels like one chunk minecraft)
